Difference between div & section :

The <div> tag and <section> tag are used in the webpage, the <section> tag means that 
the content inside relates to a single theme, and the <div> tag is used as a block part
of the web page.
The <div> and <section> tags are both used to group content in HTML, but they have 
different meanings. The <div> tag is a generic container that does not carry any
 semantic meaning. It is mostly used for grouping related elements together and applying
 styling to them via CSS. On the other hand, the <section> tag is a semantic element
 that represents a specific section of a web page with a distinct topic or purpose. 
The content inside a <section> tag will be grouped, i.e., it will connect 
to a single subject and appear as an entry in an outline of the page.
 A common rule is that the <section> element is valid only if that element’s contents 
would be listed explicitly in the document’s outline.

Difference between article & p:

- The <article> tag is a semantic tag that describes its meaning to both developer
 and browser. It specifies independencies, self-container content.
 It doesn’t require any other context. An article makes meaning of its own and it must
 distribute independently from the rest of the website(even though it can be related). 
 These tags are perfect for presenting Microdata information.
 The article element does not render anything special in a browser. By default,
 the article element is of block-level.

- The <p> tag is both presentational and semantic. It defines paragraphs in HTML.
 Anything written within <p> and </p> is treated as paragraph. The browser automatically
 adds space (a single blank line) before and after each <p> element, 
which is simply margins added by the browser. Multiple lines and spaces added by the users
are reduced to single by the browser.
By default, <p> element is of block-level. <p> tag is most useful in times when there are
multiple paragraphs to be added in articles, stories, etc.
